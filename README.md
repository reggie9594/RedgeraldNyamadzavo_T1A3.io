Onboard Logic Terminal App


Describe at a high level what the application will do

Onboard Logic is an MVP for a onboarding and timesheet app. The purpose of Onboard Logic MVP is to create a seamless onboarding process and timesheet system that will allow users to be able to onboard employees the assign payrates based on the job position (full time, part time and casual). The users will then be able to create a timesheet for those employees that can be submitted for payment processing at the end of payroll cycle. 

 Identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
 
The first problem onboard logic is solving is the use of paperwork (manual)which is very error prompt and digitalising (automating the onboard and timesheet process) which is more accurate when collecting data. This will help organisation keep track of their employees working hours, help pay staff for their correct rostered hours. The was a study that was done on organisation adopting more modern onboarding systems. The study showed that organisations that had implemented an onboarding system in their organisation, their level of productivity levels increased by 50%. Onboard logic will help more organisation increase their productivity levels by providing them with a more efficient onboarding system. 

Identify the target audience

The target audience for onboard logic will be healthcare organisation. Onboard logic will be more suited for healthcare organisation for the reason that in the future I will implement a schards award system. The SCHADS Industry Award is a complex and highly specific Modern Award covering key areas such as rest between breaks and hours of work due to the nature of the industry. This will allow employers to pay their staff members more accurately. It will cover aspects such as over time, different payrates depending on the time of the employee shift. Most importantly it will make it easy for these organisations be more compliant.

Explain how a member of the target audience will use it

1.The admin person of the organisation will an option to add the employee or go to employee list 

2. If they select to add employee the system will prompt the user to add employee full name, date of birth, job position (full time, part time and casual) and payrate
3. The system will then give the user option to view the recently added employee, create timesheet or exit 
4. If the user chooses to create timesheet the system will then prompt the user to add start time and end time, start date and end date then submit timesheet 
5. After the timesheet has been submitted the employee weekly pay will be outputted.  

Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature



Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user


Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.
